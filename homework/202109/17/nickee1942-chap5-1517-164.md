# Node outage
## how high availability
### Fail on follower
When the follower recovers, it copies all the new data from the leader
### Fail on the leader
A new leader will be selected from current followers until the failed leader recovers
#### Problem if async when the leader is failed
Follower may not have the updated data current leader has
## replica logs implementation
### statement based
### WAL
### logical 
### trigger based
## Cons for replica logs
For sync, if the leader is down, the whole system is down
For async, there might be a gap(follower is outdated) when read from followers
#Read after writes
For async system, when the user reads shortly after writes, data may only exist in the leader but not yet in the follower. So it shows no results to the user. Need to use read after writes to ensure user could get data anytime after writes
